1) First, download an extension for Google Chrome called 'get cookies.txt' (https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/get-cookiestxt/bgaddhkoddajcdgocldbbfleckgcbcid).
You may not download it if you don't want to play age-restricted videos (some music video clips and other stuff marked 'not for kids').
2) Create your discord bot on 'https://discord.com/developers/applications'.
3) Enter your discord bot token in start.sh
4) Create a virtual python environment so you won't get your home directory clogged up with unnecessary python modules: python3 -m venv .
5) chmod +x start.sh && ./start.sh
6) Invite your bot to your server.
